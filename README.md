# Dynamics Trajectory Simulation, 2018/19

The purpose of this simulation is to get the forces produced from Halbach wheels at each time step, and therefore predict the velocity, acceleration and travelled of the pod at a certain time. Everything is based on the paper "General 2-D Steady-State Force and Power Equations for a Traveling Time-Varying Magnetic Source Above a Conductive Plate", Nirmal Paudel and Jonathan Z. Bird, 2012.

The main script is called **Main.m**, the final plots are saved to **TrajectoryPlot.fig**.
The **Levitation.m** script can be used to calculate lift and drag forces as a function of velocity and air gap.

This script is based on last year's 17-18 Trajectory Sim.
